# Singleton Pattern

## Description

The **Singleton** pattern ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to it.  
It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, e.g., logging, configuration manager, or thread pool.

---

## Key Features

- **Single Instance**: Only one instance of the class exists.  
- **Global Access**: Provides a single point of access.  
- **Lazy Initialization**: The instance is created on first use.  
- **Thread-Safe (C++11+)**: Guaranteed thread-safe initialization with static local variable.

---

## Advantages

- Controlled access to the sole instance.  
- Reduces namespace pollution (no global variables).  
- Can be extended to provide flexible initialization (lazy, eager).

---

## Disadvantages

- Can introduce global state.  
- Harder to unit test.  
- Can be overused, leading to tight coupling.
